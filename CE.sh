# Cheat Engine for Proton Script:
# Based on a script from Luetti from the Cheat Engine forums, modified for Steam Proton games by KingKrouch.
#
# Requires Cheat Engine to be installed via Wine in it's default install directory.
# Feel free to tweak the stuff in the "Config" section based on the game that you are playing.
# Keep in mind that you need to have fully launched the game in the currently used Proton version once.
# Prior to running it for the first time, you need to run "chmod +x ./CE.sh" to mark this shell script as executable.
# Then, when you want to play the game with Cheat Engine, you just run "./CE.sh".

## Config: ##
##
# Here's where you should enter the Cheat Engine version that is installed.
# For this example, Cheat Engine 7.4, the experimental branch of Proton are being used as examples.
# Another example you can use instead of "Proton - Experimental" for the Proton Version name is "Proton 3.7", however, instead of using "files" for the Proton Subdirectory name, you would use "dist" instead.
CEVersion="7.4"
PROTONVERSIONNAME="Proton - Experimental"
PROTONSUBDIRECTORYNAME="files"

# This is where you should put the Steam library that you are running the game from, as the compatdata directory with the required Proton prefix will be there.
# For the local Steam install folder, this would be "/home/$USER/.steam/steam".
prefixInstall="/home/$USER/.steam/steam"

# These shouldn't change unless you installed Cheat Engine in a Wine prefix somewhere else.
# By default, you will either need WINE installed separately with Cheat Engine installed in it, or you will need to copy the CE program files needed to your Proton Prefix.
steamInstall="/home/$USER/.steam/"
CEPrefix="/home/$USER/.wine"

# Here's some flags you can tweak, although IIRC, ESync and FSync are required for Cheat Engine to function.
